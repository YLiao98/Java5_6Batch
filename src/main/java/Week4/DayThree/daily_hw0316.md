## Review 
- thread
    - join
        - If a thread wants to wait until completing of some other thread then we should go for join()
    - yield
        - If a thread wants to pass its execution to give chance to remaining threads of the same priority then we should go for yield()
    - wait vs sleep
        - wait releases the lock, sleep doesn't
        - wait can be woken up by using notify()

- mongoDB with CAP
    - follows CP
        - mongodb chooses consistency over availability because it would stop accepting writes to system
    - multi-document ACID transaction


## New Things I've learned

- JAVA Reflection
    - API to modify the behavior of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime
        - Class
            - String getName()
            - Class getClass() 
            - Class getSuperClass()
            - Class[] getInterfaces()
        - Constructors: getConstructors()
        - Fields
            - getFields
            - getDeclareFields
        - Methods: getMethods()
            - invoke an method through reflection if we know its name and parameter types. 
                - getDeclaredMethod(name, parametertype)
                - Method.invoke()
        - visibility
            - setAccessible()
- Design Pattern
    - singleton
        - eager
            ```
            public class Singleton {
                private static Singleton instance = new Singleton();
                
                private Singleton(){}
                
                public static Singleton getInstance()
                {
                    return instance;
                }
            }
            ```
        - lazy
            ```
            public class Singleton {
                private static Singleton instance = null;
                
                private Singleton(){}
                
                public static Singleton getInstance()
                {
                    if(instance == null){
                        instance = new Singleton();
                    }
                    return instance;
                }
            }
            ```
        - thread-safe
        ```
            public class Singleton {
                private static volatile Singleton instance;
                
                private Singleton(){}
                
                public static Singleton getInstance()
                {
                    if(instance == null){
                        synchronized(Singleton.class){
                            if (instance == null) { 
                            // double check
                            //creating instance of Singleton one time
                            instance = new Singleton();                    
                            }  
                        }
                        
                    }
                    return instance;
                }
            }
        ```
    - factory
        - provide creation of object based on different logic
    - builder
        - inner static class: builder class
        - method-chaining: return values of methods in a chain is **this** reference
    - proxy
        -  create a new proxy class with the same interface as an original service object. Then you update your app so that it passes the proxy object to all of the original objectâ€™s clients. Upon receiving a request from a client, the proxy creates a real service object and delegates all the work to it.
        - static
            - Create proxy class for each class.
            - implement proxy class in a way, that first it make a log entry of the method call made by the client, than delegate the call to real object.
            - problem: suppose you have 1000 classes, you'll need to write 1000 proxy classes for each class

        - dynamic
            -  create a proxy object based on the client's call and then perform generic action(logging action in our case) before delegating the call to the real object
            - java.lang.reflect.Proxy
                - Proxy.newProxyInstance(ClassLoader loader, Class<?>[] interfaces, InvocationHandler h);
                - Handler: InvocationHandler -> dynamic proxy class uses InvocationHandler as its strategy and delegates calls to its InvocationHandler
                     - invoke method is where to handle to additional code logic and invoke method
        
## Plan for Tomorrow
- coding problems
- review design pattern
    - proxy
        - static vs dynamic
    - singleton
    - factory
